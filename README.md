This project is a modern weather web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches real-time weather data from the Open-Meteo API (no API key required) and displays both the current conditions and the hourly forecast in a clean, attractive UI.

Key features include:

🌍 City search with free geocoding support

📍 Use My Location option via browser geolocation

⏱️ Live current weather (temperature, wind, humidity, rain chance)

📊 Upcoming hourly forecast in responsive cards

🎨 Modern, gradient-based UI with hover effects for a sleek experience

This project demonstrates how to integrate a free weather API into a front-end app, while also focusing on user experience, responsive design, and clean code structure by separating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
